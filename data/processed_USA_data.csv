""We will be replacing the wall that gave way but not sure with what just yet,"" Breen said.  When the stone wall gave way, about 50 feet of guardrail and the road's shoulder went with it into the lake. Crews have been clearing debris since the incident.

The slide is on the Campground run and is about 80 feet wide and 200 feet long.  Jeff Hanle (HAN'-lee), a spokesman for the Aspen Skiing Co., says slides have hit the same area three years in a row. He says the resort is working with an engineering firm to find a permanent fix.  Rich Burkley, the resort's vice president for mountain operations, says the Campground run is prone to landslides, while on other runs, springs sometimes appear and old mine shafts reopen.  The company allows natural plant growth to cover smaller slide areas but re-grades big ones so skiers can use it next season.","Snowmass resort, Aspen, CO",5km,mudslide,rain,small,unknown,0.0,,,,,glc,3729.0,United States,US,Colorado,6658.0,Aspen,0.21641,04/01/2014 12:00:00 AM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,-106.8152,39.1904

The slide occurred about a quarter mile from the intersection of Mifflin and Lebanon roads.  Mifflin Road, which was closed between Lebanon Road and Interboro Avenue, was reopened to traffic last night, said Rob Kaczorowski, the city's director of public works. He said the road would be closed again after the morning rush hour so repairs can continue.","hill between Mifflin rd and Mooney rd., Lincoln Place, Pittsburgh, PA",1km,mudslide,downpour,medium,unknown,0.0,,,,,glc,3363.0,United States,US,Pennsylvania,1929.0,West Homestead,1.91993,04/01/2014 12:00:00 AM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,-79.9213,40.3782

The damage occurred inside a triangle along Colorado's Front Range Mountains, spanning an area some 1,150 square miles (3,000 square kilometers).

Gardner said when the slide occurred, it washed out an entire chunk of Dent Bridge Road before sliding down to a lower portion, completely covering the road.  On Friday, Clearwater County issued a Disaster Declaration. Gardner said he submitted a request for state assistance Monday. He said the state can only help with funding for the response. The funds needed to rebuild Dent Bridge Road will have to come from somewhere else.  Gardner said they're hoping to have the temporary road open by Saturday, but if it continues to rain, it may take longer.

Residents and county crews spent the better part of the afternoon cleaning the muck from the road and patios on homes next to Canandaigua Lake.  William Wright, head of the Ontario County Public Works Department, said that a private culvert along the road became clogged or otherwise failed to carry the water to a cross pipe. With nowhere else to go, the water and mud cascaded across the road.  “The mud came from up above,” Wright said. “When the water comes down that hard, it tends to loosen the soil and the water carries the soil with it.”  The southbound lane of West Lake Road, just south of Wells Curtice Road, was closed for a period of time while county crews scraped up mud, broken tree branches and other debris.

Two lanes of the eastbound 91 Freeway near Green River Parkway were closed by the mudslide, according to the California Highway Patrol. The CHP was alerted about 11:30 a.m. to debris falling on the freeway, CHP Officer Gabe Montoya said. Several lanes along a 200-yard stretch of the freeway were covered in six inches of mud, he said. The CHP closed the outermost two lanes about 1 p.m. and dispatched cleanup crews, Montoya said. The lanes are scheduled to reopen by 6 p.m., and crews are working to clean up the mud before commuters hit the freeway later Wednesday, he said.

Hires said an estimated 30,000 cubic yards of rocks, mud and debris slid down the creek and into the Stehekin Landing area. The Park Service plans to remove about 18,000 cubic yards, and leave the rest to blend into the landscape. The slide covered about 20 parked vehicles and damaged dozens of bicycles kept at the landing for renting to visitors. An historic shed at the Imus Cabin filled with water and mud, and mud also encroached on a public laundry building. Hires said damages to the laundry and shower building were only minor.

The landslide happened shortly before 3 a.m.  While rocks spilled only slightly onto the northbound lanes, the concern was more about what else may come down.  “There are no damages to vehicles that I’m aware of, or injuries of that sort. It’s my understanding that someone came along, saw the rocks and notified authorities, who then in turn notified us and we closed the road,” PennDOT Spokesman Jim Struzzi said.

DOT workers poured green die into a storm drain to find out if water from the other side is seeping under the highway.  “The only thing we could tell right now is the water came from the other side of the road and apparently it’s going underneath ground,” Gioscio said. “Our goal is not to stop traffic, and we’ve got a brand new road here. That’s why we opened it up – to keep people moving,”  DOT workers say the contractor who widened the roadway is not responsible for the slide.

Caltrans and the California Department of Parks and Recreation are working together to clean up the debris, according to Azima. Caltrans engineers determined additional work is needed to stabilize the area, according to Azima. Drivers heading north out of Laguna Beach and south from Newport Beach on Coast Highway could encounter delays during the work, she said.","North Coast Highway, Laguna Beach, Ca",1km,landslide,unknown,medium,unknown,0.0,,,,,glc,5620.0,United States,US,California,22723.0,Laguna Beach,3.63362,04/01/2014 12:00:00 AM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,-117.8178,33.5574

City spokeswoman Kim Melchor said only one home is officially considered uninhabitable.  ""We're monitoring the situation,"" she said.  Affected residents are determining what can be done to address the problem, and how to pay for repairing the damage.  ""We don't have anything concrete as yet,"" said Gordon Brenner, of the city's Office of Emergency Management.  ""We're still working on the process.""  Officials said both landslides have the same cause -- record rain earlier this year that soaked sloped ground enough that it slides on bedrock.  The Broadmoor Bluffs slide is larger but moving slower, officials said.  However, neighbors said they're concerned about cracks in their homes and driveways turning into the wider chasms seen in Skyway.  Tim Mitros, the city's storm water manager, said Broadmoor Bluffs has had a landslide before.

Heavy rain two weeks ago caused a 600-foot long mudslide that wiped out Oak Trail, which runs parallel to the road, according to Jay Odegaard, La Crosse superintendent of recreation and park facilities. The ground below the road washed out, and the city’s Department of Public Works is bringing in special lifts to address concerns that it could damage the popular route up Grandad Bluff.  “It has been working its way for awhile, but it was two weeks ago that the main chunk of debris came down,” Odegaard said.  City staff have been monitoring the road closely, with Odegaard and others visiting during this spring’s heavy rains to check for wash-outs.

This will be a landmark year for the river, a popular attraction for anglers, rafters and others located about 40 miles southeast of Boise. Many people may now describe the area in terms of pre- and post-2013. A wildfire burned through much of the South Fork canyon in mid-August, blackening the slopes, scorching the riverÕs cottonwood stands and exposing thousands of acres of bare soil. Then, on Sept. 12, a thunderstorm dumped about a half inch of rain on the upper slopes north of the river and caused five mudslides in the prime fishing and recreation area between Anderson Ranch Dam and the Danskin boat launch about 10 miles downstream. The combination of wildfire and slides have changed the river and the canyon Ñ and this could just be the start of it.

Adams says it was a busy night for Department of Transportation crews. Several agencies responded to help with traffic control, including the Ivalee, Mountainboro and Sand Valley fire departments. Adams says the landslide will take some time to clear and the cleanup could continue into Tuesday.",U.S. 431 north of Atalla,1km,landslide,unknown,medium,above_road,0.0,0.0,,,,glc,9127.0,United States,US,Alabama,1704.0,Sardis City,3.96413,07/22/2016 02:14:00 PM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,-86.125,34.1386

And an apparent lightning strike knocked out the Mill Creek Water Treatment Plant Monday night, shutting it down and putting the town on its backup system.  “The plant is currently not operating and we are awaiting a new power supply which will be shipped overnight. As we will be operating exclusively on our back up system (Stillwell) for the next couple days, it could be a challenge to meet water demand,” wrote Town Manager Greg Clifton in a memo Tuesday. “The Town would like to ask its citizens and visitors to please conse","Highway 145, just west of Telluride, CO",10km,landslide,rain,small,unknown,0.0,,,,,glc,3799.0,United States,US,Colorado,1320.0,Mountain Village,1.82803,04/01/2014 12:00:00 AM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,-107.8548,37.9478

A landslide on Hanley Road forced the road to close. Engineers said that a landslide is causing the asphalt to erode.  A resident said it would likely be three weeks before Hanley Road is fixed.  Crews are also concerned because there is a water main underneath the road which could be damaged by the slide.  Another closure was reported at Weik Road. One lane of Weik Road was coned off because a giant crack developed in the middle of one of the lanes.

A culvert pipe leaked and caused the side of the hill under the road to be saturated with water, according to Apple Tree Point Lane resident Gordon Becker. He estimates the leaky pipe has been in place since the 1980s.  “If the pipe hadn’t leaked, we wouldn’t be doing this now,” Becker said. He also thinks recent heavy rains played a factor in the slide; Kingston received almost 10 inches of rain in the 10 days prior to the slide, according to weather.com.  “If you impact the hill with that much water, it’s going to move,” Becker said.  Crews were on site making repairs Dec. 16. Some residents were able to park their vehicles above the slide, allowing them foot access to the main road.

Crews from the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) worked overnight to stop the slide and stabilize the road. It was reopened to traffic by noon on Saturday, September 20.  UDOT crews cut a ditch and a berm to keep the roadway open. There has been some movement of dirt and rocks into the ditch, but the berm has held, according to UDOT spokesman Kevin Kitchen.  The slide, on aptly-named Clay Hill, is located in an area that has seen many slides and slips through the years.  A number of vehicles were caught between Halls Crossing and the slide area. They were required to return to Halls Crossing and cross to Bullfrog on the Burr Ferry.

Highway engineers say damage to KY 93 between the 8 and 9 mile marker south of Eddyville is so serious the project is more about rebuilding the roadway rather than repairing it.  The heavy rain that lead to near-record flooding across the region saturated the soil causing the roadway to drop as much as 10 feet along about a 1500-foot section of highway in the Eddy Creek area.  Early estimates indicate the cost of repair will be about $600,000.  This week, a contractor that specializes in landslide repair has drilled and placed steel posts into the slide area to help stabilize the soil.  Starting Monday the crew will drive pilings along the lower edge of the slide to further stabilize the area.

The slide took out a slice of a steep, roughly 70-foot embankment above the 1800 block of Roeder Avenue, across from Squalicum Marina.  No one was hurt, and the nearest home — a green two-story bungalow at 1919 Eldridge Ave. — took no damage to the building or its yard, said Bellingham Assistant Fire Chief Bill Hewett.

However, some residents have decided to leave for fear that a much bigger slide is on its way.  Geologists went to the site Tuesday morning to check the hill's stability. Crews say the hill is unstable, but there is no indication that there would be a massive slide.  Monday night's slide brought down several small trees and caused some damage to the roof of the garage.  Crews have roped off a section of land near the slide. The manager of a nearby apartment complex says he put up a large tarp on his property in early January to prevent a washout.

Clark County road crews on Monday closed one southbound lane at least until next week, giving them enough time to shore up 25 feet of embankment. Officials expect the repair will cost about $150,000.  “We need to re-establish the integrity of the slope,” said Greg Shafer, operations manager for Clark County Public Works.  Shafer said the lane may remain closed until the end of next week. Additional lane restrictions are possible during paving and repairs.  The highway includes two lanes in each direction, with a center turn lane.  Officials suspect stormwater runoff from heavy rain on Sunday flowed through old guardrail post holes on the west side of the highway, triggering the landslide. A nearby business reported the issue on Monday, prompting the lane closure.  The nearest business is Pioneer Fence, Deck and Supply Co., 11318 N.E. Highway 99. ","near 11318 N.E.

ÒThese are the most dangerous landslides, but they often go undetected.Ó Stark is working to change that. Along with colleague G_ran Ekstr_m, he has pioneered a new method to detect landslides by analyzing seismic waves -- the vibrations that radiate through EarthÕs crust because of sudden movements of rock, ice, magma, or debris.

Most probably have never noticed a small landslide that has been occurring there for years.  The landslide is about two miles west-northwest of McCaslin Road, between Superior and Boulder. Geologists say landslides are common and form a lot around Colorado.  ""A landslide is just a movement of earth. It is like an avalanche. But, instead of snow, you have dirt,"" said James Hagadorn, the curator of geology for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.  ""It happens because it's sliding downhill. It's heavier, and it's slippery. It's like a bar of soap on a board, you wet that board, and that soap is going to slide down,"" he said.  The landslide has recently been repaired. Hagadorn says that there are several engineering techniques that can be used to help stabilize it. And the best way to keep people safe is to monitor it, which geologists and engineers do regularly.
